Modelling:

Built a Logistic Regression model for New York dataset with price range as dependent variable. It is a categorical variable and other numerical variables have been used as independent variables. This model predicts the price range in the future.
Tried to analyze whether the cancellation policy effects the reviews given by the user. Multiple linear regression has been utilized to build the model. It is found that Cancellation policies are fairly spread out but, it doesn't make a big difference to most people.
In this hypothesis we tried to predict which room-types are preferred in different neighborhoods. The modelling technique used here is Neural Networks. Room type is the dependent variable and neighborhood, number of accommodates, bedrooms are independent variables.
Data Visualizations:

From analysis we have made on the Airbnb data set, we can say that in Brookyln neighborhood people preferred private room rather than shared room or entire apartment and the review score rating is high in Brooklyn neighborhood. In Brookyln neighborhood the average price of a room is $97 which is second lowest when compared to other neighborhood areas. So, we can say that the Brooklyn is the neighborhood where more number of booking of room are done. Therefore, Airbnb should increase the number of host in the Brooklyn neighborhood since the bookings are more.

If we consider Bronx neighborhood the average price of a room is $ 79 which is very less compared to other neighborhood areas but the review score rating and booking of a room is very less when compared to other neighborhood. So, Airbnb should look in to the problem and rectify the problem so that it results in good customer review score rating which improves the booking of the room in the neighborhood area.

Recommendations:

We have used xlminer for the analysis, as it is still being used in the IT companies, but a limitation of the xlminer tool is that it could only take 10,000 observations. So, it is resourceful to use other softwares like SaS, Spark which donâ€™t have such limitations.
With sufficient data we can work on one of our hypothesis mentioned in the initial phase, which is to find the seasonal trends in the data. Better analysis will be possible if there is large enough data. The user can make better predictions if there are large number of records. Different metrics like specificity, sensitivity should also be considered along with accuracy and ROC to evaluate models.
Advanced planning is required for Big data analysis. The organization needs to plan well in advance regarding its hardware requirements and business needs when performing this kind of analysis.
An organization becomes an Analytics 3.0 competitor if it makes business decisions based on analytics and Big data. The company should have a Chief Analytics Officer who is focused on analytics driven approach of the organization.
